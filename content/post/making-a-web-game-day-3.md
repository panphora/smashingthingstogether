# Intro

## What we'll be going over today

1. Reviewing basic programming concepts
2. Showing syntax for each piece of code
3. Going over a small code example 
4. Write pseudo code for Step 6 of the game (where we left off)
5. Go through actual code for Step 6
6. Go through steps 7-12, including adding a point system

## What we won't get to today

- Unfortuntely, we won't get to the multiplayer functionality today. However, I have a version of the code that you can review in your free time, here: https://github.com/panphora/MultiplayerCollectingGame (in order to run this code yourself, you need to sign up for a Firebase account and plug your own credentials into the code)
- If you want to see how the final version of the game works, you can view it here: https://collect-things-game.firebaseapp.com/
- I plan on writing a thorough tutorial about how to build a multiplayer game, including a bunch of things we didn't get to in class. If you want a copy, write your name and email address on the exercise sheet I'm passing around now.

## Free gift

- Also, for coming to the 3rd and final class, you get a gift that should help you on your journey to mastering JavaScript programming.
