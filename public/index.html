      <p>If you define methods for altering your collections, you get the convenience of not having to define security-issue-prone allow/deny rules. If you define these methods on both the client and the server, you get the benefit of Meteor&rsquo;s latency compensation feature. You can run into trouble, however, when you throw an error in a client-side method. You get the following unhandled exception: Exception while simulating the effect of invoking &#39;yourMethodName&#39; Throwing errors on the client and the server In order to get around this, you can create a wrapper function that will throw an error on the server and simply return it on the client....</p>

      <p>Pagination might at first seem like a pretty easy, if not downright fun, feature to implement. However, like a lot of seemingly-small features, it can quickly balloon into a multi-day or multi-week project. To give you an idea of how complicated pagination can be to implement, check out this 3 part tutorial written by the talented Nick Riebeek: Part 1 Part 1a Part 2 At the end of this tutorial, the author ends up with a well-designed, but pretty basic, pagination system....</p>

      <p>Part 1: The call stack, the event loop, the task queue, and how asyncronous functions work First, some basic context. When you run some JavaScript code, it&rsquo;s added to the task queue. Think of this as a todo list. When we reach the first item on the todo list, we move it over to another todo list called the call stack. Think of this as a todo list that you want to complete before moving on to the rest of the stuff in your main todo list....</p>

      <p>This tutorial will take you through the steps I took in order to make my first Meteor package. The Problem I wanted to be able to show some elements on the page when my app was in production (i.e. deployed to a live server) and other elements when it was in development mode (i.e. on my local machine). In the end, I wanted to be able to write code like this: {{#if isProdEnvironment}} &lt;div class=&quot;sign-up-message&quot;&gt;Please sign up for our newsletter: &lt;a href=&quot;http://eepurl.com/bjYG-9&quot;&gt;Sign up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt; {{/if}} Note: One reason you might want this functionality is if there are certain services that you don&rsquo;t want to be used for testing by your developers, like a sign up form that you don&rsquo;t want polluted with fake email addresses....</p>

      <p>Deploying Meteor webapps can be difficult. When I was trying to deploy to Digital Ocean from my Windows machine, I ran into some serious issues. They were easy enough to resolve after I figured out what they were, but they required an extra 10-20 minutes of work every deploy. I&rsquo;ve heard good things about Modulus. Supposedly they make it really easy to get things set up with their automated command line tool....</p>

      <p>If you&rsquo;re making a basic website, the accounts-ui package is a great option to get started with (https://atmospherejs.com/meteor/accounts-ui). However, if you want to add some custom styles to your sign up and login forms, follow along here. 1. Install some basic packages meteor add accounts-password meteor add juliancwirko:s-alert The accounts-password package depends on the accounts-base package, so that will also be installed. The juliancwirko:s-alert package will show alerts in the corner of the screen....</p>
